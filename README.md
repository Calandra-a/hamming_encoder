# hamming_encoder
hamming encoder/decoder

Encoder: receives a "binary" dataword, and inserts proper parity bits

Channel: a pseudo-channel, which give you the option of inserting a random one bit error in the encoded dataword

Decoder: decode the message and checks and corrects any one bit error that occurred

main function is in the decoder

Pending Update: seperate Encoder Channel and Decoder to be stand alone
