# hamming_encoder
hamming encoder/decoder

Encoder: receives a "binary" dataword, and inserts proper parity bits

Channel: a pseudo-channel, which give you the option of inserting a random one bit error in the encoded dataword

Decoder: decode the message and checks and corrects any one bit error that occurred

main function is in the decoder

- This project was made on a tight timeline with project specifcations dictating design (such as the inability to run encoder and decoder seperatly)
